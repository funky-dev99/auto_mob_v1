What is Auto Mob?
Auto Mob is a Cloud Based Mobile Application Development project which will be built by Team PrintF();. This project was chosen since this will be a good investment for SLTC Research University. We are creating Auto Mob to find a solution to the problem faced by students and staff members due to the time differentiation of shuttle services at SLTC Research University.  

Aim of Auto Mob
The aim of Auto Mob is to help manage the time of SLTC staff members and students who use the shuttle service.
Auto Mob, 
•	Implement and introduce a successful Mobile Application that allow SLTC users to lively track SLTC Shuttles.
•	Establishing a properly implementing GPS system which enables live tracking.
•	Update each user’s account after a proper user payment and initiate a system to record users travel details.

## Technologies

•	We used the flutter framework with the dart as a programming language, google cloud as a cloud platform, and firebase as a database.
•	Here we used the options of google cloud: authentication, google firestore, google storage, and real-time database.

## Features

There are email password authentication and google authentication.  After signing in this way, you will go to the signup page.  You can log into the account using the username and password, or you can log in through Gmail.
After going to the account, you can see the home page.  Here there are six main menus: location, attendance, view profile, payment, emergency, and setting.
1.	Location
By giving the current location of the student and the shuttle, you can find out how far the bus is. A poli line is used for this.

2.	Attendance
Students can mark their attendance themselves.  All these attendances are shown on a separate page.  The attendance page contains the input date, time, index number, and route.

3.	View Profile
Here you can update your profile photo.  Now the profile shows the relevant student's name, email, index number, and batch uniquely.

4.	Payment
Here you can give payment details and upload the payment slip.  Everything is saved in our cloud.

5.	Emergency
